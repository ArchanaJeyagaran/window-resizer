# Window Open Resizer
Simple Window Resizer for window.open calls made in JS. Inspiration from [https://easings.net](https://easings.net/)

## Setup
No Setup! From terminal `cd window-resizer` and then `open index.html` on Mac. Use open command equivalent for Windows and other OS.

## Breakdown
`window.open` opening animations aren't that great. This repo was designed to mimic the Apple genie effect but for window.open calls. Still a biit of work to accomplish that but take a look!.

## Questions
If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue or a PR on the repo.
